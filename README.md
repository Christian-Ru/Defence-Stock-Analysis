# Defence Stock Analysis: Impact of the Ukraine Invasion

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project analyzes how the stock prices of major **European defence companies** evolved before and after Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
It compares their performance to the **Euro Stoxx 600** benchmark to assess how the geopolitical shock influenced the European defence sector.

The analysis was conducted using **Python**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib** within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
